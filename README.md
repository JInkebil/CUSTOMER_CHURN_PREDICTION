## Project Overview
Customer attrition is a major danger to the viability and expansion of the Telecom Company business; hence this must be handled. Due to the inaccuracy and ineffectiveness of customer retention tactics, important clients are being lost. To get past this obstacle, a reliable system for predicting client attrition must be created

To accurately estimate customer turnover and perform targeted retention activities, this project utilises machine learning and sophisticated analytics techniques on existing customer data. This will enable companies to lower their customer attrition, increase customer loyalty, and preserve its competitive advantage in the fiercely competitive and dynamic telecommunications sector.

## Project Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

Develop a predictive model: Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn.
Improve retention strategies: Provide insights and recommendations to enhance customer retention efforts.
Enhance customer loyalty: Implement targeted initiatives to foster customer loyalty and reduce churn.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various customer attributes such as:

Customer demographics (age, marital status, etc.)
Service details (plan type, tenure, etc.)
Billing information (payment methods, Monthly charges etc.)
Customer support interactions
The data has been anonymized to protect customer privacy.

## Methodology
The following steps were undertaken to achieve the project objectives:

### Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA was conducted to understand the data distribution and identify key features influencing churn.

-Feature Engineering:
Created new features and selected important ones to improve model performance.
Model Selection and Training:

-Evaluated different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to find the best model.
Trained and validated the models using cross-validation techniques.
Model Evaluation:

-Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Selected the best-performing model based on these metrics.
Implementation:

## Results
The final model achieved the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: XX%
Precision: XX%
Recall: XX%
F1-Score: XX%
These results demonstrate the model's capability to accurately predict customer churn

## Conclusion
The development of the customer churn prediction system marks a significant step toward improving customer retention strategies. By accurately forecasting churn, Telecommunication companies can implement targeted initiatives to reduce customer attrition and enhance customer loyalty.
